[PYTHON-MODIFY-STRINGS] - Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.

[UPPER-CASE]

(1) Example

The upper() method returns the string in upper case:

>>>a = "Hello, World!"
>>>print(a.upper())

[LOWER-CASE]

(2) Example

The lower() method returns the string in lower case:

>>>a = "Hello, World!"
>>>print(a.lower())


[REMOVE-WHITESPACES] - Whitespace is the space between and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.

(3) Example

The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:

>>>a = " Hello, World! "
>>>print(a.strip()) # returns "Hello, World!"
