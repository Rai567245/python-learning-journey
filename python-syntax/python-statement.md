[PYTHON-STATEMENTS] 

1. A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
2. In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

The following statement prints the text "Python is fun!" to the screen:

>>>print("Python is fun!")

- In Python, a statement usually ends when the line ends. You do not need to use a semicolon (;) like in many other programming languages (for example, Java or C).

[MANY-STATEMENTS]

- Most Python programs contain many statements.

The statements are executed one by one, in the same order as they are written:

>>>print("Hello World!")
>>>print("Have a good day.")
>>>print("Learning Python is fun!")

[EXAMPLE-EXPLAINED]

- From the example above, we have three statements:

1. print("Hello World!") - The first statement is executed first (print "Hello World!").
2. print("Have a good day.") - Then the second statement is executed (print "Have a good day.").
3. print("Learning Python is fun!") - And at last, the third statement is executed (print "Learning Python is fun!").

[SEMICOLONS-(OPTIONAL&RARELY-USED)]

- Semicolons are optional in Python. You can write multiple statements on one line by separating them with ; but this is rarely used because it makes it hard to read:

>>>print("Hello"); print("How are you?"); print("Bye bye!")
