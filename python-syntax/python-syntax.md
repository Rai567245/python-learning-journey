[EXECUTE-PYTHON-SYNTAX] - As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

- Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:

>>>C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py

[PYTHON-INDENTION] 

1. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
2. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
3. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
