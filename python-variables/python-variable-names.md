[VARIABLE-NAMES] - A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:

1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
2. A variable name cannot start with a number
3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
5. A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

(1) Example (Legal variable names):

>>>myvar = "John"
>>>my_var = "John"
>>>_my_var = "John"
>>>myVar = "John"
>>>MYVAR = "John"
>>>myvar2 = "John"

(2) Example (Illegal variable names):

>>>2myvar = "John"
>>>my-var = "John"
>>>my var = "John"
