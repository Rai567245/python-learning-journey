[PRINT-NUMBERS] - You can also use the print() function to display numbers:

However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:

(1) Example

>>>print(3)
>>>print(358)
>>>print(50000)

- You can also math inside the print() function:

>>>print(3 + 3)
>>>print(2 * 5)

[MIX-TEXT-&-NUMBERS] -You can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma:

(2) Example
>>>print("I am", 35, "years old.)
